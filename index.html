					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<h4>I am currently a second-year Software Engineering student with a keen interest in Full Stack Web Development. My academic journey has been fueled by my passion for problem-solving and my ability to thrive in team settings. As I continue to acquire and refine my programming skills, my goal is to secure an internship where I can apply and expand my knowledge in a real-world setting. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy engaging with others and believe that effective communication is key to any successful project. This blend of technical acumen and interpersonal skills defines who I am as a budding software engineer.
